# Administrate Technical Exercise

## Exercise Details
*Please write a small web application that models an address book. Your solution should present a simple user-interface and
should persist the data, so that it is available after restarting any processes.*

*Your address book should list organisations and people. It should allow the user to see the names and contact details of
people in organisations, and to manage the people who are in an organisation. It should store a name and contact details for
each organisation.*

*Your address book should allow organisations and people to be created, edited and deleted.*

*The address book is for use by a single person; there is no need to build authentication and authorization in your submission.*

## My Approach

### Framwork
I chose to write this exercise in Python (v3.4.3) and Django (v1.8.18). I chose to use these versions as they are what I am most familiar with.

I primarily used PyCharm (v5.0.5) as my IDE for editing and testing.
